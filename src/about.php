<p> Hi Im DrWhat, <br>
I do shit on the internet, You can contact me via e-mail at <a href="mailto:drwhat@cryto.net">drwhat@cryto.net</a><br><br>
Perhaps you're concerned that I'm a hacker, or you think im up to no good. Many people mistake Hackers as the bad guys, Im one of those people who would call you the retard.<br>
I'm that kid you never noticed in school, but always got shit done<br>
I made evomap v2.0 a year ago, and I admit it was was Crap!? But in the past weeks I have been rebuilding the code from the ground up.<br>
Some of you mite know me from the Evony hack in November 2011, Or releasing the infomation about neatextras (Account stealers.)<br>
I have contributed code to Daisy (<a href="http://eps.ru.vu">Spitfire</a> dev and <a href="http://emap.ru.vu">emap.ru.vu</a>)<br>
Since that is no longer, I will try add the features I gave to Daisy to my own EvoMap. I am how ever still lacking the scraping code.<br>
I did try to make one, But failed :(<br>
